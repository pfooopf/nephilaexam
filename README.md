## NOTE:
I use windows to build this system I dont know if this will work in linux os or mac os.
<br>
I use laravel breeze as my scafolding for authentication.
<br>
I use tailwind as my frontend development
<br>
<br>
If you want to add more tasks use this code:
<br>
php artisan db:seed --class=TasksTableSeeder


## HOW TO SET UP THE SYSTEM
Step 1. Create a laravel database in your localhost/phpmyadmin<br>
Step 2. Change the env file base on your phpmyadmin username and password.<br>
Step 3. Migrate the database. <br>
Step 4. Use the seeders to create sample accounts and tasks.<br>
Step 5. Login and Use the task creator.<br>

## ONCE MIGRATION IS DONE THE DEFAULT ACCOUNT ARE LIKE THIS
Username: user1@example.com (change 1 to 2-10 for other accounts)
Password: Pass123!
